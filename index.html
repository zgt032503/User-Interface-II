      <div class="shortBio">
        <p> Although I am only 24 and am pretty young i have had a ride in this roller coaster of life. Whether it be fighting hunger, being homeless for an extended period of time, or even the normal hardships of being a husband and father, I have always gotten back on my feet. I have in recent years partaked in a career path of Private Security: Security Officer, Body Guard, Executive Protection, and even award night security for NBA and other various origizations. Fugitive Recovery (Bounty Hunter) has also been a passion of mine. That being said with this Pandemic at full swing i have loss the longevity that each of those careers provided. so, in my search for something that i can do that i'm passionate about that also has job security and enough revenue to take care of my family. the most logical career choice that i could come up with is Full Stack Wed Development, mainly because i enjoy building things with my hands. The frustraion of why is it not working and then the rush of reilf when you figure it out. I love a challenge, an every day change of pace, a puzzle that i can solve and then physically see the results come from my finger tips. this is the best choice for me and my family by far. </p>
